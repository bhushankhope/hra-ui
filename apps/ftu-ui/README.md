## Ftu Explorer

Examine cell type abundance and biomarker expression values for functional tissue units (FTUs).

### Overview

A functional tissue unit (FTU) is the smallest tissue organization that performs a unique physiologic function and is replicated multiple times in a whole organ. Explore medical illustrations of FTUs to view cell type populations by gene, protein, and lipid biomarkers. The FTU Explorer showcases single-cell expression data from the Anatomogram site by EMBL-EBI.
