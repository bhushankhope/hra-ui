### Exploration User Interface

An interactive tool for exploring and validating spatially registered tissue blocks and cell-type populations

### Overview

The CCF Exploration User Interface (EUI) represents data across multiple scales, supporting navigation by multiple coordinate systems, including spatial, physiologic, and organ-based browsing. The first proof-of-concept user interface for the CCF v1.0.0 became available in June 2020. The EUI continues to evolve as more data becomes available.
