## About
---

The ASCT+B Reporter includes a partonomy tree to display the relationships between various anatomical stuctures and their substructures - which is clumped with a bimodal network that depicts the relationships between these anatomical structures, their cell types and associated biomarkers. THe interactive visualization empowers you to click on a particulat node, and single out their relationships to closely view how each entity is related. The nodes in the visualization can also be sorted/sized based on their connections to further gain insights on their relationships. Along with the visualization, the Reporter is packed with many useful features like calculating statistics, comparing, searching and even temporarily uploading your own data into the visualization.

#### Architecture

The ASCT+B Reporter is built using Angular 11 accompanied by a powerful state management system called NGXS that helps to maintain a predictable state container that makes it easier to understand how the data flow works in the application. It makes the application modular, and helps in debugging and testing. Below shows all the components of the ASCT+B Reporter and how they're interlinked to create a powerful visualization tool.
