          This Registration User Interface (RUI) supports the registration of three-dimensional (3D) tissue blocks within 3D reference organs. Surgeons and others involved in the tissue procurement process can use the interface to

        <ul>
          <li>
            Enter their name to track data provenance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select a reference organ via the organ carousal (kidney, heart, spleen, colon).
          </li>
          <li>
            Select a set of common tissue extraction sites.
          </li>
          <li>
            Size the tissue block in three dimensions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enter information on tissue slice thickness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Position and rotate the 3D tissue block within a 3D reference organ so its placement correctly mirrors the tissue block extraction site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify anatomical structure tags via collision detection and manual annotation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Save all registration information into a file for easy uploading to custom templates in REDCap (or other systems) used to keep track of tissue and tissue registration data. If using the RUI integrated into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal, registration information is automatically saved with the associated tissue block.
          </li>
