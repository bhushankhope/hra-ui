          The Human Biomolecular Atlas Project (HuBMAP) will develop the next generation of molecular analysis technologies,
          computational tools, and generate foundational tissue maps in order to accelerate the construction of an atlas of
          the human body for the understanding the relationship between tissue organization and function.

        <h2 class="heading">Common Coordinate Framework (CCF)</h2>
        <p class="description">
          The HuBMAP common coordinate (reference) framework is under active development. It aims to semantically
          annotate and spatially index HuBMAP data for efficient spatial and semantic search, browsing, and filtering.
          The CCF v1.0.0 became available in June 2020. CCF Ontology documentation is available
          <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aS0Xe5uhajnNY0VsuXtHvAUVH5mnd1otheCvEzIv28s/edit#" target="_blank">here</a>
          and OWL file is available on
          <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/hubmap-ontology" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

        <h2 class="heading">CCF Exploration User Interface (EUI)</h2>
        <p class="description">
          The CCF EUI represents data across multiple scales, supporting navigation by multiple coordinate
          systems, including spatial, physiologic, and organ-based browsing. The first proof-of-concept user interface
          for the CCF v1.0.0 became available in June 2020. It continues to evolve as more data becomes available. The CCF EUI
          specification is available

          and code is available on
          <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ccf-ui" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
          A demo video is on YouTube
